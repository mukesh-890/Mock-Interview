        1. What is string
        2. is String a data type or Object
        3. What is string pool
        4. How many objects will be created in the below code

        String firstString = "Gaurav";
        String secondString = "Gaurav";
        String thirdString =  new String("Gaurav");

        5. What will be the output for below code
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        String firstString = "Gaurav";
        String secondString = "Gaurav";
        String thirdString =  new String("Gaurav");
        System.out.print("Case 1 : ");
        System.out.println(firstString == secondString);
        System.out.print("Case 2 : ");
        System.out.println(firstString == thirdString);

        System.out.print("Case 3 : ");
        System.out.println(firstString.equals(thirdString));
        }

        6. What is linkedlist
        7. How linkedlist is stored in memory
        8. What is the time complexity of insertion and deletion in singly linkedlist

        DSA question medium difficulty 

        Merge all nodes with the sum value between the occurence of two zeros

        Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
        Output: [4,11]
